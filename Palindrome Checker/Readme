This task was to create a program which would accept a string input (or hard-coded string) to be tested for being a Palindrome.
A palindrome is a mirrored word that reads the same forwards or backwards.

The stipulations were that the string must be at least 3 characters long and that it could not be null.

The second part of the task was to output the longest palindrome within a sentence of multiple words.
